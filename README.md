# tincan

__no_std async I/O abstractions and utilities.__

**tincan** allows writing applications that use message-oriented I/O
without knowledge of the underlying stream.
It also contains utilities for constructing I/O streams,
including wrapping raw byte streams in arbitrary protocols (e.g. TLS).
